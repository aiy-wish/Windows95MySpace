            <p id = "para1">Honestly i am not even a 90's kid. I was born in 2000. But whatever tech i have seen back in the day was pretty similar and now 
                i have a obsession of the old stuff and the phases i have been through. My music is mostly from the 80's 90's and 00's and early 2010's.
                There was some magic back then which i can't find it now unfortunately. There are very few things out there which excites me. Maybe that's what growing up is like, 
                you lose excitement as you grow up.

                And about Windows 95? Well there is that nostalgia factor attached to it and reminds me about how simple times were. I was not even born when it was launched but the "Home Computer"
                 had the windows 95 and i used to learn stuff from there. And especially when i started using the internet, most websites looked like as static as this WebPage.
